        <p> My name is Malesha Jones. I currently work for Spectrum, formerly known as Time Warner Cable. 
            I was recentely prompted to RSC Rep IV, working as part of the quota team. In this faction of the department,
            I assist with managing available time to make sure there are appointments available to customers who need someone to come out & service there home.
            I enjoy the new position & happy to be apart of the team.
        </p>

        <p> When I am not at work, I spend most of time catching up my favortire shows, exercising, and spend time with my family.
            I love watch Disney movies, read, draw, and shop. My favortie color is pink & anything that is rose gold.
            My favortie time of the year is fall, & one of my favortie holidays is Halloween.
        </p>
